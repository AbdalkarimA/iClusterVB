#' @title Simulated Dataset
#'
#' @description The dataset consists of \eqn{N = 240} individuals and \eqn{R =
#'   4} data views with different data types. Two of the data views are
#'   continuous, one is count, and one is binary. The \emph{true} number of
#'   clusters was set to \eqn{K = 4}, and the cluster proportions were set at \eqn{\pi_1
#'   = 0.25, \pi_2 = 0.25, \pi_3 = 0.25, \pi_4 = 0.25}, such that we have
#'   balanced cluster proportions. Each of the data views had \eqn{p_r = 500}
#'   features, \eqn{r = 1, \dots, 4}, but only 50, or 10\%, were relevant features
#'   that contributed to the clustering, and the rest were noise features that
#'   did not contribute to the clustering. In total, there were \eqn{p =
#'   \sum_{r=1}^4 = 2000} features.
#'
#'   For data view 1 (continuous), relevant features were generated from the
#'   following normal distributions: \eqn{\text{N}(10, 1)} for Cluster 1,
#'   \eqn{\text{N}(5, 1)} for Cluster 2, \eqn{\text{N}(-5, 1)} for Cluster 3, and
#'   \eqn{\text{N}(-10, 1)} for Cluster 4, while noise features were generated from
#'   \eqn{\text{N}(0, 1)}. For data view 2 (continuous), relevant features were
#'   generated from the following normal distributions: \eqn{\text{N}(-10, 1)} for
#'   Cluster 1,    \eqn{\text{N}(-5, 1)} for Cluster 2, \eqn{\text{N}(5, 1)} for Cluster
#'   3, and \eqn{\text{N}(10, 1)} for Cluster 4, while noise features were generated
#'   from \eqn{\text{N}(0, 1)}. For data view 3 (binary), relevant features were
#'   generated from the following Bernoulli distributions:
#'   \eqn{\text{Bernoulli}(0.05)} for Cluster 1,    \eqn{\text{Bernoulli}(0.2)} for
#'   Cluster 2, \eqn{\text{Bernoulli}(0.4)} for Cluster 3, and
#'   \eqn{\text{Bernoulli}(0.6)} for Cluster 4, while noise features were generated
#'   from \eqn{\text{Bernoulli}(0.1)}. For data view 4 (count), relevant features
#'   were generated from the following Poisson distributions:
#'   \eqn{\text{Poisson}(50)} for Cluster 1, \eqn{\text{Poisson}(35)} for Cluster 2,
#'   \eqn{\text{Poisson}(20)} for Cluster 3, and \eqn{\text{Poisson}(10)} for Cluster 4,
#'   while noise features were generated from \eqn{\text{Poisson}(2)}.
